\section{Introduction}

The parallelization of code for the simulation of complex mechanical systems is a key-topic in modern computational mechanics. Constantly increasing computing power of high-performance clusters allow for the simulation of large and complex systems. This requires an efficient parallelization approach, where different parallelization paradigms can be of use. \\

In this report the parallelization of a finite element code for the simulation of the stationary temperature distribution on a two-dimensional disk is investigated. For the shared memory approach the OpenMP library is used, where as the distributed memory approach is assessed by using a one-sided parallelization approach with MPI. The different parallelization approaches are discussed and compared for different number of CPUs. This report is structured as follows. In the second chapter \textit{Theory and Methods} are presented. The \textit{Implementation and Validation} of the presented problem is discussed in chapter 3. The results of the optimization of the runtime of the code is illustrated in chapter 4 \textit{Results} and the assessment of the different optimization techniques is discussed in chapter 5 \textit{Discussion}. Finally, this report is closed with a \textit{Conclusion} in chapter 6.
